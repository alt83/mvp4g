== Architecture Overview ==

[architecture.png]

As we can see on this diagram, each UI knows only two other objects:
 * the event bus
 * the RPC services (not mandatory)

== Sequence diagram ==

[diagram_sequency.png]

As we can on this sequence diagram:
 * Events are sent by presenters to the event bus. 
 * The event bus dispatches the events to other presenters that handle the sent event.


The framework will help the developper to:
  * Set an event bus without having to use the GWT Handler and to create two classes/interfaces for each event (one for the event, one for the handler). This event bus will be easily configurable thanks to a xml file.
  * Set dependency injection thanks to the xml file (in progress, not implemented yet)
