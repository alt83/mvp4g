#summary How Mvp4g works

= Introduction =
= Introduction =
The main idea of the Mvc4g framework is to help the developper to use the GWT best pratices (Event bus, MVP and Dependency Injection) when building his application.

The framework will help the developper to:
  * Set an event bus without having to use the GWT Handler and to create two classes/interfaces for each event (one for the event, one for the handler). This event bus will be easily configurable thanks to a xml file.
  * Set dependency injection thanks to the xml file (in progress, not implemented yet)
