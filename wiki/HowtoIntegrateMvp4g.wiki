#summary How to integrate Mvp4g to your project

== Introduction ==
To integrate Mvp4g to your project, the following steps need to be done
  # Add needed library to your project
  # Modify your GWT configuration file (`*`.gwt.xml) and your entry point  
  # Create your presenters and set your events 
  # Create a Mvp4g configuration file for your project
        

== Library ==

Add the following libraries to your project:
  * Commons Lang ([http://commons.apache.org/downloads/download_lang.cgi Download here])
  * Commons Configuration ([http://commons.apache.org/downloads/download_configuration.cgi Download here])
  * Mvp4g ([http://code.google.com/p/mvc4g/downloads/list Download here])  


== GWT configuration file ==

Insert Mvp4g module to your project:
{{{
<inherits name='com.mvp4g.Mvp4gModule'/>
}}}

Add the following line to your entry-point
{{{
Mvp4gStarter starter = GWT.create(Mvp4gStarter.class);
starter.start();
}}}


== Mvp4g Presenters ==
Create your project presenters(s). See how to create a view [Mvp4gBasics here].

== Mvp4g configuration file == 
Create in your project source directory a file mvp4g-conf.xml. Your file must start with and end by the tag `<mvp4g>`.
{{{
YourGWTModule
     |--- src
          |--- mvp4g-conf.xml
}}}
